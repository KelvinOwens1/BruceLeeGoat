      <h1>About Bruce Lee</h1>
      <div>
        <p class="indent">
          Bruce Jun Fan Lee (Lee Siu Loong) was born in 1940 in San Francisco,
          CA while his parents were on tour with the Chinese Opera. Ultimately
          raised in Hong Kong, Bruce Lee was a child actor appearing in more
          than 20 films. At the age of 13, Bruce took up the study of wing chun
          gung fu under renowned wing chun master, Yip Man.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Bruce left Hong Kong at the age of 18, came to the United States and
          made his way to Seattle, Washington where he worked in the restaurant
          of a family friend. He soon enrolled in the University of Washington
          where he pursued a degree in philosophy. Bruce began to teach gung fu
          in Seattle and soon opened his first school, the Jun Fan Gung Fu
          Institute. Two more schools followed in Oakland and Los Angeles.
          Concurrently Bruce married his wife, Linda and had his two children,
          Brandon and Shannon. In the mid sixties, Bruce was discovered while
          doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals and a role as
          Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet soon followed. During this
          time, Bruce was also developing his own martial art, which he
          ultimately named Jeet Kune Do (translated: the way of the intercepting
          fist).
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Bruce's art was steeped in a philosophical foundation and did not
          follow long held martial traditions. Instead it had at its core the
          ideas of simplicity, directness and personal freedom. After The Green
          Hornet series was canceled, Bruce encountered resistance while working
          in Hollywood and so headed to Hong Kong to pursue a film career. In
          Hong Kong he made 3 films, which consecutively broke all box office
          records and showcased martial arts in an entirely new way. Hollywood
          took notice and soon Bruce was making the first Hollywood / Hong Kong
          coproduction with a film called Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately, Bruce
          Lee died in 1973 before this film was released. This film catapulted
          him to international fame. Today Bruce Leeâ€™s legacy of self
          expression, equality, and pioneering innovation continues to inspire
          people all around the world.
