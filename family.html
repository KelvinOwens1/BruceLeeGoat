      <h1>Bruce Lee's Family</h1>
      <div>
        <p class="indent">
          Lee's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was one of the leading Cantonese opera
          and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year-long opera
          tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong.
          Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and
          performing in numerous Chinese communities there.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen
          returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong
          was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under
          Japanese occupation. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his
          acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's
          rebuilding years.

          Lee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most
          powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs. She was the half-niece of
          Sir Robert Ho-tung, the Eurasian patriarch of the clan. As such, the
          young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment.
          Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighbourhood in
          which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang
          rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for
          Hong Kong, at that time a British Crown Colony.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Grace Ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of
          Ho Kom-tong (Ho Gumtong, 何甘棠) and the half-niece of Sir Robert
          Ho-tung, both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists. Bruce
          was the fourth of five children: Phoebe Lee (李秋源), Agnes Lee
          (李秋鳳), Peter Lee, and Robert Lee.

        <p class="indent">
          Bruce Lee with his son Brandon in 1966 Grace's parentage remains
          unclear. Linda Lee, in her 1989 biography The Bruce Lee Story,
          suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic. Bruce
          Thomas, in his influential 1994 biography Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit,
          suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father. Lee's
          relative Eric Peter Ho, in his 2010 book Tracing My Children's
          Lineage, suggests that Grace was born in Shanghai to a Eurasian woman
          named Cheung King-sin. Eric Peter Ho said that Grace Lee was the
          daughter of a mixed race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom
          Tong. Grace Lee said her mother was English and her father was
          Chinese. Fredda Dudley Balling said Grace Lee was three-quarters
          Chinese and one-quarter British.

        <p class="indent">
          In the 2018 biography Bruce Lee: A Life, Matthew Polly identifies
          Lee's maternal grandfather as Ho Kom-tong, who had often been reported
          as his adoptive grandfather. Ho Kom-tong's father, Charles Maurice
          Bosman,[150] was a Dutch Jewish businessman from Rotterdam. He moved
          to Hong Kong with the Dutch East India Company and served as the Dutch
          consul to Hong Kong at one time. He had a Chinese concubine named Sze
          Tai with whom he had six children, including Ho Kom Tong. Bosman
          subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California. Ho Kom
          Tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife, 13 concubines, and a
          British mistress who gave birth to Grace Ho.

          His younger brother Robert Lee Jun-fai is a musician and singer; he
          performed in the Hong Kong group The Thunderbirds. A few singles were
          sung mostly or all in English. Also released was Lee singing a duet
          with Irene Ryder. Lee Jun-fai lived with Lee in Los Angeles in the
          United States and stayed. After Lee's death, Lee Jun-fai released an
          album and the single by the same name dedicated to Lee called "The
          Ballad of Bruce Lee".

          While studying at the University of Washington he met his future wife
          Linda Emery, a fellow student studying to become a teacher. As
          relations between people of different races was still banned in many
          US states, they married in secret in August 1964. Lee had two children
          with Linda: Brandon (1965 - 1993) and Shannon Lee (born 1969). Upon's
          Lee passing in 1973, she continued to promote Bruce Lee's martial art
          Jeet Kune Do. She wrote the 1975 book Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew,
          on which the 1993 feature film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story was based.
          In 1989, she wrote the book The Bruce Lee Story. She retired in 2001
          from the family estate.

        <p class="indent">
          Lee died when his son Brandon was eight years old. While alive, Lee
          taught Brandon martial arts and would invite him to visit sets. This
          gave Brandon the desire to act and went on to study the craft. As a
          young adult, Brandon Lee found some success acting in action-oriented
          pictures such as Legacy of Rage (1986), Showdown in Little Tokyo
          (1991), and Rapid Fire (1992). In 1993, at the age of 28, Brandon Lee
          died after being accidentally shot by a prop gun on the set of The
          Crow.

        <p class="indent">
          Lee died when his daughter Shannon was four. In her youth she studied
          Jeet Kune Do under Richard Bustillo, one of her father's students;
          however, her serious studies did not begin until the late 1990s. To
          train for parts in action movies, she studied Jeet Kune Do with Ted
          Wong.
