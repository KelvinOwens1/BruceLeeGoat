      <h1>Bruce Lee's experience with Martial Arts</h1>
      <h3>Martial arts and fitness</h3>

      <div>
        <h3>Striking</h3>
        <p class="indent">
          Lee's first introduction to martial arts was through his father, from
          whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style tai chi. In his teens,
          Lee became involved in Hong Kong gang conflicts, which led to frequent
          street fights. The largest influence on Lee's martial arts
          development was his study of Wing Chun. Lee was 16 years old
          under the Wing Chun teacher Yip Man, between late 1956 and 1957, after
          losing to rival gang members.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, chi
          sao (sticking hands) drills, wooden dummy techniques, and free
          sparring. There was no set pattern to the classes. Other Chinese
          martial arts styles Lee trained in were Northern Praying Mantis,
          Southern Praying Mantis, Eagle Claw, Tan Tui, Law Hon, Mizongyi, Wa
          K'ung, Monkey, Southern Dragon, Fujian White Crane, Choy Li Fut, Hung
          Gar, Choy Gar, Fut Gar, Mok Gar, Yau Kung Moon, Li Gar, and Lau Gar.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee was trained in boxing, between 1956 and 1958, by Brother Edward,
          coach of the St. Francis Xavier's College boxing team. Lee went on to
          win the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament in 1958, while scoring
          knockdowns against the previous champion Gary Elms in the final. After
          moving to the United States, Lee was heavily influenced by heavyweight
          boxing champion Muhammad Ali, whose footwork he studied and
          incorporated into his own style in the 1960s.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee demonstrated his Jeet Kune Do martial arts at the Long Beach
          International Karate Championships in 1964 and 1968, with the latter
          having higher-quality video footage available. Lee is seen
          demonstrating quick eye strikes before his opponent can block, and
          demonstrating the one-inch punch on several volunteers. He
          demonstrates chi sao drills while blindfolded against an opponent,
          probing for weaknesses in his opponent while scoring with punches and
          takedowns. Lee then participates in a full-contact sparring bout
          against an opponent, with both wearing leather headgear.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee is seen implementing his Jeet Kune Do concept of economical
          motion, using Ali-inspired footwork to keep out of range while
          counter-attacking with backfists and straight punches. He halts
          attacks with stop-hit side kicks, and quickly executes several sweeps
          and head kicks. The opponent repeatedly attempts to attack Lee, but is
          never able to connect with a clean hit. He once manages to come close
          with a spin kick, but Lee counters it. The footage was reviewed by
          Black Belt magazine in 1995, concluding that "the action is as fast
          and furious as anything in Lee's films."
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met taekwondo master
          Jhoon Goo Rhee. While Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail, Lee
          taught Rhee the "non-telegraphic" punch. Rhee learned what he calls
          the "accupunch" from Lee and incorporated it into American taekwondo.
          The "accupunch" is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block,
          based on human reaction time—"the idea is to finish the execution of
          the punch before the opponent can complete the brain-to-wrist
          communication."
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee commonly used the oblique kick, made popular much later in mixed
          martial arts. It is called the jeet tek, "stop kick" or "intercepting
          kick", in Jeet Kune Do.
        </p>

        <h3>Grappling</h3>
        <p class="indent">
          Lee favored cross-training between different fighting styles, and had
          a particular interest in grappling. Lee trained with several judo
          practitioners in Seattle and California, among them Fred Sato, Jesse
          Glover, Taky Kimura, Hayward Nishioka and Wally Jay, as well as Gene
          LeBell. Many of his first students were proficient in judo and other
          arts, and he learned as much as he taught. After befriending LeBell on
          the set of The Green Hornet, Lee offered to teach him striking arts in
          exchange for being taught grappling techniques. LeBell had been taught
          catch wrestling by prestigious grapplers Lou Thesz and Ed Lewis, and
          notable techniques of both judo and catch wrestling can be seen in
          Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do. He also learned grappling moves from
          hapkido master Ji Han-jae.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          According to Glover, Lee only found judo ineffective at the action of
          getting hold of the opponent. In their first training together, Glover
          showed Lee an osoto gari, which Lee considered not a bad technique,
          but he disliked that Glover had needed to hold onto Lee. While in
          Seattle, Lee developed anti-grappling techniques against opponents
          trying to tackle him or take him to the ground. Glover recalled Lee
          "definitely would not go to the ground if he had the opportunity to
          get you standing up." Nonetheless, Lee expressed to LeBell a wish to
          integrate judo into his fighting style. He incorporated the osoto gari
          into Jeet Kune Do, among other throws, armlocks and chokeholds from
          judo.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Although Lee opined that grappling was of little use in action
          choreography because it was not visually distinctive, he
          showcased grappling moves in his own films, such as Way of the Dragon,
          where his character finishes his opponent Chuck Norris with a neck
          hold inspired by LeBell, and Enter the Dragon, whose prologue features
          Lee submitting his opponent Sammo Hung with an armbar. Game of Death
          also features Lee and Han-jae exchanging grappling moves, as well as
          Lee using wrestling against the character played by Kareem
          Abdul-Jabbar.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee was also influenced by the training routine of The Great Gama, an
          Indian/Pakistani pehlwani wrestling champion known for his grappling
          strength. Lee incorporated Gama's exercises into his own training
          routine.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h3>Street fighting</h3>
        <p class="indent">
          Another major influence on Lee was Hong Kong's street fighting culture
          in the form of rooftop fights. In the mid-20th century, soaring crime
          in Hong Kong, combined with limited Hong Kong Police manpower, led to
          many young Hongkongers learning martial arts for self-defence. Around
          the 1960s, there were about 400 martial arts schools in Hong Kong,
          teaching their own distinctive styles of martial arts. In Hong Kong's
          street fighting culture, there emerged a rooftop fight scene in the
          1950s and 1960s, where gangs from rival martial arts schools
          challenged each other to bare-knuckle fights on Hong Kong's rooftops,
          in order to avoid crackdowns by British colonial authorities. Lee
          frequently participated in these Hong Kong rooftop fights. He combined
          different techniques from different martial arts schools into his own
          hybrid martial arts style.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          When Lee returned to Hong Kong in the early 1970s, his reputation as
          "the fastest fist in the east" routinely led to locals challenging him
          to street fights. He sometimes accepted these challenges and engaged
          in street fights, which led to some criticism from the press
          portraying him as violent at the time.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h3>Fitness</h3>
        <p class="indent">
          At 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) and weighing 64 kg (141 lb), Lee was renowned
          for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated
          fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with
          Wong Jack-man in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts
          training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend
          enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of
          total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular
          endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional bodybuilding
          techniques to build some muscle mass, though not overdone, as that
          could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time, with respect to
          balance, Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are
          fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts
          skills. In Tao of Jeet Kune Do he wrote:
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much
          time is given to the development of skill and too little to the
          development of the individual for participation. ... JKD, ultimately
          is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed
          spirituality and physique.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          According to Linda Lee Cadwell, soon after he moved to the United
          States, Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an
          interest in health foods, high-protein drinks, and vitamin and mineral
          supplements. He later concluded that achieving a high-performance body
          was akin to maintaining the engine of a high-performance automobile.
          Allegorically, as one could not keep a car running on low-octane
          fuels, one could not sustain one's body with a steady diet of junk
          food, and with "the wrong fuel", one's body would perform sluggishly
          or sloppily.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Lee avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as
          providing empty calories that did nothing for his body. He was known
          for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety, and often ate meals
          with a combination of vegetables, rice, and fish. Lee had a dislike
          for dairy products and as a result, used powdered milk in his diet.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
          Dan Inosanto recalls Lee practised meditation as the first action on
          his schedule.
